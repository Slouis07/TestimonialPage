Reviewers is a testimonial page where people can access guidelines, checklists, and other tools to assist them in reviewing papers or manuscripts. It provides a structured approach to ensure that the review process is thorough, efficient, and consistent. The page includes headings, body text, checklists, and testimonial cards styled with CSS. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

### What I learned
Working on this project strengthened my **HTML & CSS structuring** skills, particularly:
- How to create a **responsive layout** using CSS Grid & Flexbox.
- Styling **testimonial cards** to match a specific design.
- Using **semantic HTML** for better accessibility and SEO.
- Troubleshooting **Netlify deployment** issues and making a clean GitHub repo.
